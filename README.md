Welcome to my Python repository! üêç

Here you‚Äôll find some of my Pythonic projects, where things work most of the time (80% of the time, it works 100% of the time). If something goes wrong, it‚Äôs probably part of the plan.

  **Here you‚Äôll find:**
- **Task Automator**: Because pressing buttons manually is so last century.
- **Clean Code**: Readable and maintainable code (not always as clean as it should be).

Feel free to explore, criticize (gently, please), or just laugh at the creative solutions.
